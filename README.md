# Hosuing Price Prediction

## Introduction

Welcome to the Housing Price Predictor project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the prices based on different hosuing parameters.

### Project Goals

- Implement a robust MLP model for price prediction.
- Evaluate and fine-tune the model for optimal performance.
- Provide an open-source solution for others to use and contribute to.
